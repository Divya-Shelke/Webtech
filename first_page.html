    <h1>Rose</h1>
    
    <p>A rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa (/ˈroʊzə/),[4] in the family Rosaceae (/roʊˈzeɪsiːˌiː/),[4] or the flower it bears. There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars.[citation needed] They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles.</p>
    
    <p>Most rose species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers being native to North America and a few to Europe and northwest Africa. Roses from different regions of the world hybridize readily, giving rise to types that overlap the parental forms, and making it difficult to determine basic species</p>
